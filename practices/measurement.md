# Measurement 

These practices measure an operating model to decide if it’s worthy of further investment. The cost effectiveness of business outcome protection is an informative, actionable measure of an operating model. 

Leading and trailing measures can be used to gauge progress in deployment throughput, service reliability, and learning culture. It’s important to select measures that are holistic, actionable, and do not create the wrong incentives. See [*Measuring Continuous Delivery*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08LYZDPMK) by Steve Smith.

|This customer was a fintech startup, with very limited money and skilled employees. It was a greenfield project in every sense, including business processes as well as technical implementation. I worked on the single technical team responsible for delivery, and therefore the onus of the entire system was on us. It was the classic case for You Build It You Run It.<br><br>To achieve this, automation was key. Adoption of Continuous Delivery enabled us to focus our energy on development, not deployments. All our changes were tested and deployed through a single automated pipeline, for simplicity and ease of tracking. Operational tasks needed to be in code as well, to allow for seamless deployments of infrastructure and application changes.<br><br>Monitoring and system reliability were at the heart of the system design as well, since reduced issues meant more time for development. Code quality and system health awareness checks also steered the interests of our team.<br><br>Since the business and operational knowledge was contained within our team,  the customer only needed to contact us to raise their issues.  This meant issues were resolved rapidly, and learnings from the issues were fed back into the design, testing and monitoring of the system.
