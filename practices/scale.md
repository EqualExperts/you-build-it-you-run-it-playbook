|I work on the digital platform team at John Lewis & Partners. We’ve built a digital platform that allows product teams to do You Build It You Run It as easily as possible. It’s part of the reason why [John Lewis & Partners won a digital platform award](https://medium.com/john-lewis-software-engineering/our-award-winning-john-lewis-digital-platform-2d093e03d542)!<br><br>In late 2019, we already had 30 digital services, and another 30 were forecast for a year later. We knew having one person on-call per digital service wouldn’t be cost effective, especially for digital services that aren’t business critical out of hours.<br><br>Before development of a new digital service begins, the platform team has a non-technical onboarding conversation with the product manager and architect for the digital service. We have to agree on:<ul><li>Availability target. We use revenue and brand as the primary indicators of business value, and financial exposure.</li><li>On-call level. We select an on-call level based on the availability target. We’ve implemented no on-call for digital services at 95.0% availability, domain on-call schedules for 99.0% availability, and team on-call schedules at 99.9%.</li><li>Product domain. The business domain that owns the digital service. This forms the basis for a domain on-call schedule at 99.0% availability.</li></ul>Availability target and on-call level aren’t set forever. Once a digital service is live, they can vary based on trade patterns, day of the year, and incremental revenue.<br><br>A majority of our digital services fall into the bracket for domain schedules. A digital service is covered overnight by a developer from the owning product team, or a sibling team in the same product domain. This incentivises product teams to focus on operability even though they don’t have the highest availability target. It spreads product knowledge between teams, and establishes a common language around the domain and upstream/downstream dependencies. Most importantly, it’s cost effective, as the number of people on-call does not scale linearly with teams.<br><br>We use PagerDuty as our incident management platform. We’ve automated the creation and grouping of digital services in PagerDuty, based on their on-call level and product domain. If you work on a product team that’s part of a domain schedule, all you have to do in PagerDuty is find the entry for the domain, and add in your overnight support. All the administration is done for you.
