|Managing on-call at John Lewis & Partners|

|In 2020, the product team responsible for registration and authentication at John Lewis & Partners was delivering a roadmap to decommission a legacy system, and introduce an integration with a third party identity provider.<br><br>The team began to launch features involved in the checkout process, which were dependent on the new identity provider. This meant resolving high profile incidents involving lost sales became part of their world.<br><br>Over two weeks, we met several times as a team to decide what we wanted our out of hours support to look and feel like.This included updating our runbooks, dashboards, and logging. We reviewed the incident management process, and agreed amongst ourselves how we defined an on-call shift.<br><br>The knowledge the team was the first and last line of defense for registration and authentication, at any hour of any day, was baked into every line of code. Did that mean we had no incidents? Definitely not. But when incidents were resolved, we could quickly implement any improvement actions to avoid a repeat incident.<br><br>Things that worked well included:<ul><li>Mutually supporting some team members who were more nervous about running out of hours support.</li><li>Regularly debriefing alerts, to establish a common view of what could happen.</li><li>>Building positive relationships with the operations teams supporting the legacy systems we were replacing.</li><li>Performing dry alert runs, to decide which alerts to configure for out of hours notifications.</li><li>Documenting exactly how to raise an incident with a specific third party provider.</li></ul>Learning how to work with the third party provider was particularly important. We figured out that asking them what made a support ticket useful would help us to get a useful response in the first instance, rather than wait for multiple delays.<br><br>![Erin O'Connor](../.gitbook/assets/practices/erin-oconnor.jpg)<br><br>[Erin O'Connor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deliveredge/)<br><br>Delivery Lead<br><br>EE UK|
