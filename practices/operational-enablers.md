|The support toolchain for You Build It You Run It at a payments provider|
|---|
|We were engaged by one of the leading EMEA payments providers to build a payment gateway which could be white labelled for each tenant. The payments gateway was launched in multiple countries, with different payment integrations for different tenants.<br><br>The product team responsible for building the payments gateway was also responsible for running on-call support. Understanding the product features helped us to surface and monitor the right metrics. We also built an extensible alerting system, which could be configured for each tenant. When a new tenant was onboarded, a default alerting profile was assigned to them. The alerting profile was then gradually updated, based on the transaction volume and payment features opted into by the tenant. This helped to avoid false alerts.<br><br>Since the same team was responsible for building and running the payments gateway, we iterated on metrics and alerts as part of every feature cycle. We ensured every request was traced across services and external integrations. Dashboards were built for every alert, to reduce the response time for them. When the alerts were triggered, the product team was notified along with the right dashboards. Being on-call gave us an accurate context to prioritise and fix errors as they occurred.<br><br>![Anant Pal](../.gitbook/assets/practices/anant-pal.jpg)<br><br>[Anant Pal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anantkpal/)<br>Anant Pal<br>EE India|
