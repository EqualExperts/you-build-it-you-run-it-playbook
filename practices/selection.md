|Traffic lights You Build It You Run It in retail|

|I worked at a large retailer in Australia, where we gradually moved teams and their services from Ops Run It to You Build It You Run It. The transition can be hard, and to ensure a pragmatic approach we introduced a traffic light system. We used it to help us decide if a service should remain in Ops Run It, or be moved to You Build It You Run It.<br><br>We tracked outcomes for each service, including its availability target and deployment frequency target, to determine where they were on the traffic lights.<ul><li>Red was for a fortnightly deployment target, or lower and meant Ops Run It.</li><li>Green was for a weekly deployment target or higher, and meant You Build It You Run It.</li><li>Amber was for a deployment target that lay in between. The service availability target was used as a tiebreaker. We had previously concluded 99.9% was not possible to achieve under Ops Run It, as it only permitted 44 minutes of downtime in a month. So a target of 99.9% or higher meant You Build It You Run It, and a target of 99.0% or lower meant Ops Run It.</li></ul>The traffic light system meant we could look at services holistically. We could build a clear picture of how many services were in Ops Run It, how many were ready to transition into You Run It, and how many required more careful thought. It allowed us to clearly see across the digital estate where we needed to focus our efforts, on changing the operational model to gain the biggest benefit to the organisation.<br><br>![Tony Nguyen](../.gitbook/assets/practices/tony-nguyen.jpg)<br><br>[Tony Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonynguyenoz/)<br>Director<br>EE Australia|
