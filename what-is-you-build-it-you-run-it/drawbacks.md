# Drawbacks of You Build It You Run It

## Deployment throughput

* *High setup cost*. It takes weeks or months to establish a new, streamlined change management process for digital services.
  * Moving accountability for change approvals from a change management team to product managers takes weeks or months. 
  * Moving accountability for production deployments from an application support team to on-call product teams takes weeks or months.
  * Creating a new change approval process in a central ticketing system like ServiceNow takes weeks or months. 

The countermeasure here is for product teams to solve problems for the change management team, not just for themselves. This can include providing change managers with: 

* A list of change approval criteria that product managers will consistently follow.
* A set of automated integrations for change requests into the central workflow system. 
* A standing invite to all product planning meetings and pre-deployment product demos.
* An automated email notification whenever a deployment has happened.
* An automated web page showing recent change requests and the associated deployments.
