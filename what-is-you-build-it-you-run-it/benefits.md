# Benefits of You Build It You Run It

You Build It You Run It benefits come from team empowerment, and clear operability incentives. There’s no hard divide between siloed delivery and operations teams. There are no time-consuming handoffs, nor any diffusion of responsibility. A product manager is incentivised to constantly balance the prioritisation of operational features alongside product features, because they’re accountable for service reliability. A product team is incentivised to build operability into their digital services, because they’re on-call out of hours for their own work.

## Deployment throughput

* *Fast change approvals*. Frequent, low risk deployments have pre-approved standard change requests, which involve no change management team time. Infrequent, high risk deployments may still require a CAB meeting, and incur the same [change approval delays as Ops Run It](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/drawbacks).
* *Fast deployments*. Deployments take minutes to complete successfully. An on-call product team can perform a deployment in working hours with no handoffs, and they can fully automate their own deployment pipeline to minimise deployment failures.  
* *Focus on outcomes*. Digital services are created to deliver customer outcomes. Live traffic data is used to create product hypotheses, which are tested against customer feedback.
* *Low knowledge synchronisation costs*. An on-call product team can store most of its service documentation within the code itself, and use its own runbooks to store acquired operational knowledge. Knowledge synchronisation takes minutes between team members, as they already work within the digital service on a daily basis.
* *No scheduling conflicts*. An on-call product team can reschedule its deployments as and when necessary, without any conflicting workload priorities. 
* *Low running costs*. The costs of performing deployments and rolling back failed deployments can be extremely low. An on-call product team has sole responsibility for their automated deployment pipeline, and can devote as much time to it as necessary.
* *Proactive change management*. Change managers can become involved in digital service delivery before and during live traffic. They can contribute to deployment patterns, ask for changes to post-deployment health checks, and receive a fully automated audit trail from a deployment pipeline.   

These benefits add up to low opportunity costs for a digital service. You Build It You Run It minimises the cost of delay between product feature readiness and launch, because change approvals and deployments can happen so quickly. This also applies for additional infrastructure capacity, library upgrades, and security patches.
