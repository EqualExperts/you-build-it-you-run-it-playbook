# What is You Build It You Run It

An ever-increasing number of organisations have an IT department that includes on-call product teams responsible for building and running digital services. Each team builds and runs long-lived products, and provides 24/7 support for them. This is known as You Build It You Run It, a phrase first coined by [Werner Vogels in 2006](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065): 

> Giving developers operational responsibilities has greatly enhanced the quality of the services, both from a customer and a technology point of view. The traditional model is that you take your software to the wall that separates development and operations, and throw it over and then forget about it. Not at Amazon. You build it, you run it. This brings developers into contact with the day-to-day operation of their software. It also brings them into day-to-day contact with the customer. This customer feedback loop is essential for improving the quality of the service.

As explained by Jez Humble et al in [Lean Enterprise](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425), it’s a myth that IT governance standards require segregation of duties. You Build It You Run It is compatible with IT Service Management (ITSM), IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) v3 Service Transition, ITIL v3 Service Operations, [PCI-DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) for credit card payments, and [SOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act) for USA federal securities. 

There’s no divide between Delivery and Operations functions in You Build It You Run It. There are no short-lived delivery teams. There are long-lived on-call product teams, who own their digital services from inception to live traffic and potentially through to decommission. They are incentivised to move fast, and provide reliability.

Operations teams are likely to exist alongside You Build It You Run It. They will manage COTS applications and foundational systems. They also remain responsible for lower-level operational capabilities, such as on-premise Domain Name System (DNS) and firewall management.

Every organisation is different, and every You Build It You Run It implementation is different. See our [operating model examples](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/examples) from our customers.
