# Benefits of Ops Run It

We've split Ops Run It benefits into realised versus unrealised benefits, i.e. actual versus on paper benefits. In our experience, many of the theoretical benefits of a central operations team simply don't happen for digital services. 

## Realised

These are the few benefits for digital services we expect to actually see in practice.

### Deployment throughput

We don't usually see any deployment throughput benefits. For a majority of organisations, [Ops Run It can't achieve weekly or daily deployments](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/drawbacks). Some small or medium-sized organisations may overcome this, if they implement the [Ops Run It deployment throughput variant](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/deployment-throughput) and delivery teams self-service some deployments. However, it's unusual to see that work well. 

### Service reliability

We see some benefits, related to cost management and governance: 

* *Low setup costs*. Ops Run It has a [low implementation cost](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/service-reliability), as it's so well-established in the IT industry. There's plenty of training courses, online reading materials, and vendor tools that are compatible with multi-level production support. 
* *Low running costs*. Ops Run It has [low running costs](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/service-reliability). The help desk, operations bridge, and application teams can centrally manage the availability of tens of digital services, COTS applications, and foundational systems as necessary.
* *Running cost reduction options*. Running costs can be [lowered by outsourcing](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/service-reliability), as the general skills and technical expertise for help desk, operations bridge, and application support teams are in a worldwide abundance. 
* *Straightforward governance*. Accountability, responsibilities, and visibility are all easy to understand. The senior manager in the Operations function is accountable for all aspects of reliability. 

For COTS applications and foundational systems, these benefits can outweigh the [unrealised benefits](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/benefits#unrealised) and many [drawbacks of Ops Run It](https://you-build-it-you-run-it.playbooks.ee/what-is-ops-run-it/drawbacks). We've seen plenty of organisations outsource one or more operations teams to a third party managed service, to minimise their running costs. However, if an application support team has built up substantial domain expertise with a proven impact on incident resolution times, the case for outsourcing is not as clear cut.
