# What is Ops Run It

Many organisations have an IT department with segregated Delivery and Operations functions. 
Delivery teams in the former are responsible for building services, and operations teams in the latter are responsible for running services. We call this Ops Run It. We often find it's entwined with long-established IT management standards such as [ITSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management) and [ITIL v3](https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-certifications).

Ops Run It has been a de facto operating model for decades, and was codified by the [COBIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBIT) management framework in 1996. COBIT recommended functionally-oriented teams of specialists, working within separate Plan, Build, and Run phases. That was justified by the unavoidably high compute and transaction costs for on-premise software in the 1990s. That pre-Internet rationale doesn't hold true today. 

Ops Run It creates a hard divide between Delivery and Operations, powered by radically different incentives. Delivery teams are short-lived, and project-based. They're told to move fast and achieve their deliverables. Operations teams are long-lived, and told to move carefully and provide reliability. 

It's important to remember that every organisation is different, and every Ops Run It implementation is different.
